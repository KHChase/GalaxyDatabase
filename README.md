# GalaxyDatabase
CSCE A311 group project for the Astronomy Lab

This program was created for use by the UAA Astronomy Lab.

The main focus of this program is searching.

The program prompts the user for which search they would like to do:

1. Search by galaxy: User will be prompted to enter the name of the galaxy they'd like information for
2. Search by column: User prompted to enter the column name they'd like to search for
3. Search for a galaxy-specific value: User prompted for galaxy name and column title
4. Search for multiple values: User will be prompted to search by range, search by match, or exit search
     a. **Search by range: prompts user for the column to search, and an upper and lower bound**
     b. **Search by match: Prompts user for the column to search, and the target value**
